# roomgame

Touch-controlled building game for "Powerwall" with 12 times full HD resolution.

The game features an underwater environment. You try to build a complex of rooms while the red guy smacks holes into them, which causes your creation to be flooded. You can repel the flood by tapping it at its edges and eventually repair the holes. The bigger your room complex and the less water in it, the higher is your score.
